# Mediasync

TODO:

- verify websocket origin header
- do all the discord integration so it works as an Activity
- add videojs-youtube
- present errors nicely on the frontend eg. multiple connections with same user token should show a warning rather than silently failing, a message should be shown when the user is disconnected, etc.
